Welcome to the developer's manual for librsvg.  This is for people who
want to work on librsvg's development, nor for users of the library or
the `rsvg-convert` program.

Before embarking on big changes to librsvg, please write a little
design document modeled on the following ones, and submit a merge
request.  We can then discuss it before coding.  This way we will have
a sort of big-picture development history apart from commit messages.
