# Development documentation for librsvg

Before embarking on big changes, please write a little design document
modeled on the following ones, and submit a merge request.  We can
then discuss it before coding.  This way we will have a sort of
big-picture development history apart from commit messages.

Design documents:

* [`adding-a-property.md`](adding-a-property.md) - Tutorial on how to
  add support for a new CSS property.  Should remain always current.
