  <title>Overview of Librsvg's API</title>

  <para>
    Librsvg's API is divided into two main parts:  one for loading SVG
    data and one for rendering it.  In the <emphasis>loading
    stage</emphasis>, you create an RsvgHandle object from SVG data,
    which can come from a file or from a stream of bytes.  In the
    <emphasis>rendering stage</emphasis>, you take an RsvgHandle and ask
    it to render itself to a Cairo context.

    <title>Loading</title>

    <para>
      RsvgHandle is an object that represents SVG data in memory.
      Your program creates an RsvgHandle from an SVG file, or from a
      memory buffer that contains SVG data, or in the most general
      form, from a GIO stream that will provide SVG data.  At this
      stage you can get either I/O errors or parsing errors.  If
      loading completes successfully, the RsvgHandle will be ready for
      rendering.

    <title>Rendering</title>

    <para>
      Once you have a loaded RsvgHandle, you can render it to a Cairo
      context any number of times, or to different Cairo contexts, as
      needed.
